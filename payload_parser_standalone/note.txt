1. Latency Hiding
Starting decoding immediately allows the system to perform useful work in parallel with length parsing. 
By the time the valid_flag is asserted, the parsed data is already available and ready for use. 
This avoids delays in downstream logic. 
In contrast, a non-speculative design would wait for the length to be validated before starting the decode, 
introducing extra latency.

2. Constant Throughput and High Clock Utilization
In a non-speculative system, each message introduces an additional delay of several cycles before decoding 
begins. A speculative pipeline, however, keeps all stages active simultaneously—decoding, validating, 
and committing in parallel. This enables consistent throughput of one message per N cycles, 
rather than N plus additional latency.

3. Pipeline Compatibility
Speculative decoding fits well with deep pipelined FPGA architectures. 
Typical pipeline stages include the parser, length validator, commit stage, 
and downstream logic such as an order book or trading engine. Each stage remains fully utilized, 
eliminating pipeline bubbles and ensuring efficient area usage and deterministic timing.

4. Decoder Simplicity
The decoder only concerns itself with field extraction based on message type 
and does not need to track message length. This separation of parsing and validation simplifies decoder logic, 
improves testability, and supports modular development. The validator becomes reusable, 
and the commit stage can be adapted independently.

5. Parallel Early Filtering
Certain decoded fields—such as symbol or quantity—can be routed to early filtering or monitoring logic, 
even before full validation is complete. This allows for prefetching, early routing, or triggering alerts, 
which can reduce overall system latency. If validation later fails, 
the operation can be retracted or discarded without impacting correctness.
